        <h1>About</h1>

        <div class="what">
          <h2>What is CoinCollection?</h2>
          <p>
            CoinCollection is a web-app where you can view all of your cryptocurrency assets
            from Coinbase, Gemini, and Ledger Live in one place. CoinCollection acts as a
            centralized portfolio, gathering data from your other portfolios in
            order to know how much of an asset you have across all of your
            accounts. In the cryptocurrency universe, it is common to transfer
            your assets across different accounts; some users buy their coin on
            exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, and then transfer those assets to
            a hard wallet like Ledger. With that being said, it can be tedious
            to know how much Bitcoin you have in total if you have to hop around
            three different accounts every time you’re curious. With CoinCollection, the
            allocation is done for you.
            <br />

        </div>

        <div class="how">
          <h2>How does CoinCollection work?</h2>
          <p>
            CoinCollection utilizes standard REST API’s from Coinbase and Gemini, as well as
            the operations history CSV from Ledger Live. When the user submits
            their API Key and API Secret from Coinbase and or Gemini, the
            backend makes API calls to the respective exchange’s REST API to
            gather data on their assets. The real-time price of an asset is
            gathered using the CoinMarketCap API. Coinbase offers an API call
            that gathers the real-time price of an asset, but Gemini does not.
            Therefore, the CoinMarketCap API was used to gather the real-time
            prices for scalability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Design Decisions</h1>
        <div class="complications-ledger">
          <h2>Complication with Ledger Live</h2>
          <p>
            As Ledger’s hardware acts as a cold wallet, the device only holds
            your private transaction keys and nothing else; your Ledger device
            doesn’t have a ‘centralized account’ where you can view all of your
            assets virtually. Therefore, the only way to view your Ledger assets
            in code is through parsing the Operations History CSV.
            Unfortunately, the CSV only tracks transactions done on a single
            device, so if you connect your Ledger wallet to a different device
            and import your crypto then you wouldn’t be able to see the
            transactions made on that device through a single CSV. The only
            other option to view your Ledger assets virtually would be to grab
            your public transaction keys for your assets from Ledger and then
            view those transactions on the blockchain, but the work to grab a
            user’s public transaction keys would not be worth the effort for
            this web-app. Ledger offers a JavaScript API, but that API cannot be
            utilized for this program because that API is meant to connect a
            DAPP to Ledger Live, and there is no way to gather a user’s balances
            from that API.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="complications-other">
          <h2>Other Complications</h2>
          <p>
            The best way to centralize the assets across Coinbase and Gemini was
            to use API keys that utilizes the respective exchange’s REST APIs.
            As of the creation of this program, Gemini only offers one REST API,
            and Coinbase offers multiple REST APIs, including a Sign In with
            Coinbase API. The Sign In with Coinbase API would allow a user to
            sign into the program with their Coinbase account, but that API does
            not obtain the balances of cryptocurrency assets in that user’s
            account, probably for security reasons.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Why</h1>
        <p>
          As stated above, it is common to transfer your assets across different
          accounts; some users buy their coin on exchanges like Coinbase or
          Gemini, and then transfer those assets to a hard wallet like Ledger.
          In certain US states, there are regulations on which states can buy
          and can’t buy certain coins. Also, some exchanges are capable of
          trading a certain coin, while another exchange are not (For example,
          ENJIN coin was not capable of being purchased on Coinbase, but it was
          capable of being purchased on Gemini). Switching between wallets to
          view your assets can be very tedious, and for investors, doing the math on
          how much of $USD you have invested in total into crypto is an
          important value to know. This program takes care of all of that for you.
